        <h3>About Sarah</h3>
            <p>I'm a recent graduate of UW Madison, where I majored in English- Creative Writing and minored in Folklore.</p>
            <p>After graduation, I spent many months applying to jobs in the writing field with no results. 
                It seemed no matter how much time and effort I put into the job search, nothing seemed to work.
                However, having recently discovering coding, I feel a brand-new pathway has opened up for me that I really enjoy.
            </p>
            <p>While I still love literature and folklore, I am excited to continue down the path of software development!</p>
